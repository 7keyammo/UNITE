We are excited to announce the official launch of **UNITE Saturday School** — a revolutionary Afrocentric learning space dedicated to the youth of our community.

Our Saturday programming centers around:
- Afrocentric STEAM education
- Energy, frequency, and vibration exploration
- Knowledge of self and ancestral wisdom
- Hands-on, project-based learning

We’re building a future where every student sees themselves as a scientist, creator, and leader.

Stay tuned for schedules, sign-up info, and downloadable resources.
